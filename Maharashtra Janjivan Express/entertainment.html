    <h3><b>Adipurush movie release and review Live Updates: Can Prabhas-starrer eclipse Pathaan’s day 1 box office record?</b></h3>
   <p>Adipurush, the much-awaited film of Telugu superstar Prabhas, hits the theaters on Friday. The mythological drama is a retelling of the Hindu epic, Ramayan. In the film, helmed by Om Raut, Prabhas plays Lord Ram, Kriti Sanon stars as Sita, Sunny Singh is Lakshman and Saif Ali Khan plays the role of Ravana.
    The film is made on an enormous budget of Rs 500 crore. After its advance bookings opened on Sunday, the film did a 
    business of Rs 12 crore. The national theatre chain PVR sold over one lakh tickets in the Hindi market itself and 
    trade analysts are expecting a huge opening at the ticket counters across the country.
    Film trade analyst Girish Johar pegged the film’s opening day collection at Rs 50 cr, including all languages. 
    Speaking about the craze around Ramayan among Indians, film trade expert Taran Adarsh said, “For me, the most important
    thing is not Prabhas, Kriti Sanon or Saif Ali Khan. For me, it is Ramayan, and it is a very strong emotion. Everything
    else is secondary,” he states, while agreeing that many Indians watching the film will resonate with his emotion.” 
    New reports suggested that the first day collection can be even higher, and may eclipse Shah Rukh Khan-starrer 
    Pathaan’s first day collection.</p>
