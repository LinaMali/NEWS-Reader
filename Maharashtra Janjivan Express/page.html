      <h3><b>PM Modi’s visit to Washington DC set to boost defence cooperation:
         Key deals and co-production initiatives on the agenda</b></h3>
     <p>As Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for his visit to Washington DC starting June 21, several pending defence 
      deals are expected to take center stage in discussions with US officials.
      The co-production of defence equipment is a key theme underlying these discussions. By promoting local manufacturing
      and technology transfer, India aims to enhance its self-sufficiency in defence production, aligning with its long-term 
      goals of self-reliance and indigenization. As both India and the US continue to deepen their defence cooperation,
      agreements and co-production initiatives have the potential to not only strengthen their bilateral ties but also
      contribute to regional security and stability.</p>

    <h3><b>On Party Foundation Day, NCP Expresses Concern Communal Unrest Incidents in Maharashtra</b></h3>
    <p>Senior leaders of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Saturday expressed concern over the recent incidents of 
       communal unrest witnessed in parts of Maharashtra, including Kolhapur.
       Addressing an event held in Mumbai to mark completion of 24 years of the NCP’s formation,
       party MP Supriya Sule said these incidents were not good for democracy, while its state unit chief Jayant Patil 
       claimed that creating communal unrest through social media was something that never happened in the past.
       Tension gripped Kolhapur on Tuesday after two men allegedly put 18th-century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan’s image 
       along with an offensive audio message as their social media status.
       The next day, the police had to disperse hundreds of protesters after they hurled stones during a demonstration 
       in the city against the alleged use of Tipu Sultan’s image. In Ahmednagar district, police registered a case 
       against four persons for allegedly carrying posters of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb during a procession taken out 
       on Sunday. The action was taken after a video of the incident went viral.</p><br />

       <h3><b>Doesn't Suit Any Leader to Criticise Own Country Abroad: Shah Slams Rahul; Asks Him to Learn from His Ancestors</b></h3>
       <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused Rahul Gandhi of criticising India and discussing its internal 
        politics during his visits to foreign countries, and said the Congress leader should learn from his ancestors.
         Shah said it does not suit any leader to criticise one’s own country abroad, and asked Gandhi to keep in mind that 
         people of the country were watching him.
        He was referring to Gandhi’s criticism of the Narendra Modi government during his recent tour of the USA. 
        “Any patriotic person should discuss Indian politics within India. It does not suit the leader of any party to go
         abroad and discuss the country’s politics and criticise the country. Rahul baba, you must remember that people of 
         the country are watching it closely," Shah said.
        “Rahul baba is going abroad on a vacation to escape the summer heat. He keeps criticising the country there.
         I would like to suggest Rahul Gandhi to learn from his ancestors," he said.Shah was addressing a rally at Siddhpur
         town in Patan district of Gujarat organised to mark nine years of the Modi government.
         The country has witnessed huge changes under the Modi government, but Congress does not stop talking about
         anti-India things, he said. Shah also attacked Gandhi over its criticism of the new Parliament building. 
         “You opposed the new Parliament building and installation of ‘Sengol’, a historical sceptre from Tamil Nadu,
         there. The Sengol was to be installed by Jawaharlal Nehru. Modi is doing it because he (Nehru) did not do it,
         then why are you opposing?" he asked. Congress leaders do not allow PM Modi to speak in Parliament and only
         keep opposing everything, Shah alleged, and added that the PM has started a new tradition of doing 
         “politics of development". Shah also attacked Gandhi over the issues of Ram temple in Ayodhya and the 
         abrogation of Article 370. Lord Ram’s temple at Ayodhya was desecrated since the time of Babar 
         (founder of the Mughal empire), he said. “But today, a grand temple of Lord Ram is under construction 
         and it will be completed shortly," he said.</p><br />

         <h3><b>'Rahul Gandhi Grows Beard Like Osama Bin Laden': Bihar BJP President Mocks Cong Leader; RJD MP Reacts</b></h3>
        <p>Bhartiya Janata Party’s Bihar president Samrat Choudhary on Saturday said that Congress leader Rahul’s Gandhi’s
         beard is like that of slain Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, and that one cannot become India’s prime minister 
         just by growing a beard.
         Addressing a rally in Bihar’s Araria district, the BJP leader said, “Congress leader Rahul Gandhi grows beard
         like Osama bin Laden and thinks that he will become like Prime Minister Narendra Modi," news agency ANI reported.
         Choudhary was talking about a beard that Gandhi grew during his Bharat Jodo Yatra, and shaved it off subsequently.    
         RJD MP Manoj Jha reacted to Chaudhary’s jibe on Gandhi and said that “crores of people in this country keep a beard, 
         are they all Osama Bin Laden?
         Apart from his comments on Gandhi, Choudhary also took at dig at Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, saying that 
         he is going around the country and telling everyone he is the prime minister if the country.</p> <br />

     <h3><b>Maha: Man Held for Objectionable Social Media Post Against Fadnavis, Senior Leaders</b></h3>
       <p>he police on Saturday arrested a man from Maharashtra’s Sangli for allegedly putting up an objectionable post on
         social media against Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and other senior politicians, an official said.
         Based on a complaint lodged by an activist from the Eknath Shinde faction of Shiv Sena, the Naupada police in Thane 
         registered a case against the accused under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, he said.
        The accused had allegedly posted objectionable matter on social media against Fadnavis, Kalyan MP Chief Minister
         Eknath Shinde’s son Shrikant and other senior politicians, the official added. </p><br />

         <h3><b>'Not Consulted': Kerala Congress Factions Dissatisfied with Reorganisation of Block Presidents</b></h3>
        <p>here is resistance against the leadership in Kerala Congress, especially leader of opposition VD Satheesan, with 
            the ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups coming together. Both groups held a secret meeting on Friday to discuss issues and 
            dissatisfaction related to the reorganisation of block presidents.
         Their main issue, however, is against Satheesan and it is quite unprecedented for these groups to come together. 
         The major complaint by senior leaders is that they are not consulted on any issue. 
         Kerala Congress president called I group leader Ramesh Chennithala and A group leader Hassan for separate meetings. 
         After the meeting, Chennithala said there were serious issues with reorganisation in Kerala. He added that the state 
         leadership had not done anything to resolve them and senior leaders were completely ignored.
         They approached Kerala general secretary incharge Tariq Anwar and will be apprising president Mallikarjun Kharge
         of the situation. They want the high command to take corrective measures.
         Chennithala, a former opposition leader, said, “The issue has to be resolved but unfortunately the state leadership has not done anything. 
         There is no proper discussion in the state and senior leaders were totally ignored and there was no consultation and
         a democratic way to sort out the issue. Last two years, everything has been going on arbitrarily, so no action has 
         been taken and that is why we are very upset.”
         Hassan, also the UDF convener, said the main issue was there was no consultation. There should be a proper discussion
         over the decisions taken, he added.    
         Satheesan denied the allegations and said proper discussions were held before making any decision. 
         “We have gone the democratic route during the reorganisation of block presidents. We have discussed with the leaders. It is unfair to say we didn’t discuss it with them. We had discussed with them at every stage at the district and state level,” he said.
