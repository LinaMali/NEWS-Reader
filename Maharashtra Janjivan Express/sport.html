        <h3><b>Asia Cup 2023 to be held in Pakistan, Sri Lanka in hybrid model from August 31 to September 17</b></h3>
        <p>With no choice left after Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan backed out of their proposed 'Hybrid Model', 
            Pakistan could withdraw from Asia Cup, as per PTI. 
        The 'Hybrid Model' of PCB proposed by chief Najam Sethi, Pakistan were to host 3 to 4 games of the Asia Cup while 
        games involving India could be held at a neutral venue.This was proposed after India refused to play in Pakistan 
        due to security concerns."It is just a formality now that the Asian Cricket Council executive board members meet
        virtually or a proper meeting is called later this month. But the PCB is now aware that Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and
        Afghanistan are not backing their hybrid model proposal for the Asia Cup," said a source.
        "Pakistan only has two options. Play the tourney at neutral venue or withdraw. In case Pakistan doesn't play, 
        it will still be called Asia Cup but broadcaster will renegotiate the deal in absence of Pakistan. 
        There is every possibility the Asia Cup might not be held this year because without Pakistan and India matches 
        the broadcasters are not likely to offer the same amount they were offering to the ACC with Pakistan included," it added.

    <h3><b>How extensive scouting and diligent scouts have made Mumbai Indians the superstar team they are</b></h3>
    <p>Before the 2022 IPL auction, Mumbai Indians management was in two minds, whether to release the uncapped Akash Madhwal.
        The coaches sought feedback of talent scouts,and one of them insisted on giving him more time to blossom.
        Before the Indian Premier League auction in 2022, the Mumbai Indians team management was in two minds,
        whether to release uncapped medium pacer Akash Madhwal. 
        Their dilemma was understandable, the seamer had not quite set domestic cricket on fire.At the age of 28 then,
        he was not too young either.The coaches sought the feedback of their talent scouts, and one of them insisted on
        giving him more time to blossom.He did not feature in a single game last year, but in an injury-wracked season
        this term,he was handed out a debut and justified the coaches’ faith with 13 wickets in seven games,including
        remarkable figures of 5/5, the best-ever in an IPL playoff match,in the Eliminator against Lucknow Super Giants.
        Madhwal is not alone in Mumbai’s long list of players plucked from obscurity,
        from maidans to distant corners of the vast country,unusual talents that could have withered away unseen and unspotted.
        None bigger than Jasprit Bumrah,arguably the finest pacer India has ever produced. His rise to fame is well 
        documented: how the scouts wanted to track another cricketer and stumbled onto a youngster with a wispy beard and
        quirky action.The discovery is widely credited to John Wright, but there is an entire network of unseen hands and 
        eyes that track talented youngsters across the breadth of the country, apart from ex-cricketers such as Parthiv Patel,
        R Vinay Kumar, Kiran More, Rahul Sanghvi, RP Singh, TA Sekar along with Wright, who rejoined the franchise this year
        after missing the last season due to COVID-19.</p><br />

   <h3><b>Virat Kohli Joins Sachin Tendulkar in Elusive List, Reaches Incredible 2000-run Milestone Against Australia During WTC Final 2023</b></h3>
   <p>Virat Kohli on Saturday surpassed plenty of milestones, joining the legendary Sachin Tendulkar in an elusive list of 
    cricketers following his unbeaten 44-run knock against Australia in the World Test Championship (WTC) final on June 10.
    Kohli became only the second Indian batter after Tendulkar to score more than 5000 runs against Australia, across all
     formats. Virat came out to bat after India lost Shubman Gill and Indian skipper Rohit Sharma early, needing a record
     444-run total to win the WTC final 2023.At the Oval, Kohli managed to etch his name in the history books as he
     became only the second Indian batsman after Tendulkar to amass more than 5000 runs against Australia. 
     The 34-year-old reached the massive milestone while smashing a boundary on the first ball of the 40th over 
    of India’s second innings on Day 4.</p><br />

    <h3><b>Watch: Romelu Lukaku’s late miss caps tough-luck Champions League loss for Inter Milan</b></h3>
    <p>The chance for Inter Milan to score and tie the game late in the Champions League final was as clear as any team
     could hope for.The ball floated slowly across the Manchester City goalmouth in the 89th minute toward the head of
     towering striker Romelu Lukaku, who stooped slightly four yards (meters) out with half the goal open to aim for.
     Lukaku’s forehead guided the ball toward the net -– but almost straight at goalkeeper Ederson, whose left leg pushed
     it toward safety.omehow the 1-0 lead was intact and minutes later Man City was European champion for the first time,
      completing a rare treble with the English league and cup titles already sealed.
     “I’m still wondering how it’s possible that we didn’t score at the end,” Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said. 
     “We clearly deserved more.” It had seemed inevitable that a striker of Lukaku’s quality, the all-time record scorer 
     for Belgium, would find the net. Almost 20,000 Inter fans massed at that end of the stadium could hardly believe he
      didn’t.</p><br />

      <h3><b>Highlights Manchester City Vs Inter Milan, UCL Final: Rodri’s Solitary Goal Hands Blues First European Crown</b></h3>
   <p>Manchester City have finally conquered club football’s highest peak on Saturday, thanks to a second-half goal from 
    an unlikely scorer in Rodri. Pep Guardiola have joined Zinedine Zidane in the UEFA Champions League elite group to
    win three titles as manager. Like Mourinho and Ancelotti, the Spaniard has now did it with multiple clubs. 
    Following this 1-0 win, Manchester City now became the second English club after Manchester United and the first
    side since 2019-20 Bayern Munich, to win the treble.

    <h3><b>French Open 2023, Novak Djokovic vs Casper Ruud: When and where to watch Men’s Singles Final</b></h3>
    <p>By India Today Sports Desk: Casper Ruud and Novak Djokovic are all set to face each other in the French Open
    Men’s singles final on Sunday, June 11 on Court Philippe-Chatrier.Djokovic is looking to win his 23rd Grand
    Slam and become the most successful male player, going past Rafael Nadal, who is not a part of the ongoing
    tournament. Djokovic has two Roland Garros titles to his name and, given the form he is in, one can’t rule
    him out of the final by any means.Djokovic had to fight in his quarters and semis against Karen Khachanov 
    and Carlos Alcaraz, but put forth his A-game at the right time to come up trumps.Ruud, on the other hand, 
    beat Germany’s Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the semi-final. The star from Norway made his way through 
    to the French Open and US Open final back in 2022, but lost to Rafael Nadal and Alcaraz respectively</p>
    <h3><b>Singapore Open: PV Sindhu, HS Pronnay, Lakshya Sen knocked out in 1st Round</b></h3>
    <p> Several Indian stars were knocked out in the first round of the Singapore Open on Tuesday, 6 June.
         Notable Indian stars Lakshya Sen, HS Prannoy, PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal failed to go beyond the Round of 
         32 of the tournament losing their respective matches. Kidambi Srikanth was the anomaly among the bunch
          defeating his opponent in straight sets in the game.</p>
