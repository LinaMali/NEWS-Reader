     <h3><b>Self-motivated, visually-impaired Pune student eyes big as she is set to join IIM Indore</b></h3>
     <p>She may not see the colourful birds but enjoys their chirping every morning. No matter whether roses are red or 
        yellow, 20-year-old Sakshi Amrutkar simply loves their smell. For this Pune woman, born blind, it is now her time
        to reassure and support her parents as she moves on to pursue higher studies at the Indian Institute of Management,
        Indore – the first student from the National Federation of Blind Maharashtra (NFBM) Jagriti School for Blind Girls,
        Alandi, to do so.On June 25, Sakshi will join the institution and on top of her bucket list is to purchase the 
        first-ever flight tickets for her parents. “They were horrified to find that I could not see and despite 
        multiple rounds of medical checkups I was diagnosed with a condition called retinitis pigmentosa – a group of
        rare eye and genetic disease that affect the retina,” says Sakshi and adds that with no cure she motivated 
        herself to excel academically.“My mother used to scan pages of the textbook and would convert it into a pdf or
        Word document so that I could use the TalkBack screen reader to study. I got a laptop later during college 
        days and that made studying a lot easier,” she adds.Assistive Technology has helped specially challenged 
        children not just with studies but other obstacles like making payments and today Sakshi is comfortable going
        to the shop or mall and making her own purchases and payment.Her father’s fabrication unit shut down during
        Covid pandemic and mother who is a librarian manages a fair amount of household expenses. Her parents’ 
        struggle motivated her to perform well.She cleared the CA Foundation course in the first attempt at the age
        of 16 but decided to pursue higher studies in strategic management. She appeared for the Common Admission
        Test (CAT) last year and after interviews she got calls from 11 Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).
        Finally, she decided to study at IIM-Indore. Sakina Bedi, project director of NBFM Jagriti School and 
        NBFM national spokesperson, says Sakshi is the first such student from among the 350 alumni to have got
        into a top B-school.</p><br />

        <h3><b>In special forecast for Pandharpur Wari, IMD predicts hot, humid weather</b></h3>
        <p>The Pandharpur Wari, the annual pilgrimage procession from several parts of Maharashtra to honour Lord Vitthal,
        will test the resolve of lakhs of devotees this year as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has
        predicted hot and humid temperatures for the first seven days.“During the early phase of the Palkhi 
        pilgrimage, the weather will be suffocating and uncomfortable, especially between 10.30 am to 4 pm. 
        Organisers should take full precaution to avoid dehydration,” Dr Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting
        at the IMD, said. Thunder and lightning with spells of rain are likely in the afternoons in the first phase.
        The pilgrimage from June 10 to June 29 will see lakhs of devotees walking from the temple towns of Dehu and 
        Alandi to Pandharpur.The IMD has been issuing annual pilgrimage forecasts for the last few years.
        “Staring Friday, we will be issuing forecasts till the end of the event to update pilgrims about the weather 
        a couple of days in advance,” Kashyapi added.A majority of the devotees are from the farming community and 
        finish their sowing before participating in the pilgrimage. This year, however, Maharashtra is yet to see
        any significant rainfall and sowing is yet to start.

    <h3><b>Mumbai Live News Updates: ‘Fear of Thackeray, Shiv Sena is visible’ Sanjay Raut
             reacts to Amit Shah’s Nanded speech</b></h3>
      <p>Reacting to Union Minister Amit Shah’s speech in Maharashtra’s Nanded, Uddhav Thackeray Faction leader Sanjay 
        Raut said, “In Shah’s 20-minute speech in Nanded, 7 minutes he spoke only about Thackeray, which means that
        Matoshree’s dominance is still intact. Shiv Sena party was broken, and names and symbols were given to 
        traitors. Even after this, fear of Thackeray and Shiv Sena is visible, this fear is good,” quoted ANI.
        Amit Shah, while addressing a rally in Maharashtra’s Nanded yesterday, had also pitched for the return of the
        Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government in 2024. “It was your support and faith in PM Modi’s leadership that
        helped the BJP get an absolute majority and complete nine years successfully. In 2024, do you want Rahul Gandhi
        or Narendra Modi? The people of Nanded will give the answer,” Shah said. Meanwhile, elevation of Nationalist 
        Congress Party (NCP) leader and Baramati MP Supriya Sule as party’s national working president once again
        cast a shadow on party leader Ajit Pawar, two months after reports were making rounds about Ajit Pawar
        joining hands with the BJP despite he denying any such move. On Saturday, NCP leaders were quick to ward 
        off any such speculations. Pawar ridiculed the reports about Ajit Pawar’s unhappiness saying it does not 
        have even 1% of truth. On Saturday, Sharad Pawar announced that Praful Patel and Supriya Sule will be the
        working presidents of the NCP.</p><br />
